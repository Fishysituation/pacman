# pacman
Pacman clone, started as extension of 1st year computing group project at Imperial College London

The ghost behaviour is different to the original in that they will always travel via the shortest path to catch pacman. This was done by modelling the game board as a graph with nodes being all valid move spaces and creating a routing table using a variation of Floyd-Warshaw's all pairs shortest path algorithm
